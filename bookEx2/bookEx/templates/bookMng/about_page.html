<h2>What This Is</h2>

The Bookshelf is a website that facilitates access to
books that are freely readable over the Internet. It also
aims to encourage the development of such online books, for
the benefit and edification of all.
<p>
    Major parts of the site include:

</p>
<ul>
    <li><a href="displaybooks">An index of
        unlimited online books freely readable on the Internet</a>
    </li>
    <li><a href="mybooks">Pointers to
        significant directories and archives of your personal favorites</a></li>
    <li><a href="postbook">Access to adding a specified book from a catalogue</a></li>
</ul>

    <h2>Who's Responsible, and Who Supports It</h2>

    The Bookshelf was founded, and is edited, by Henry Gonzales, Amy Guttman, Rayan Hyder, Jonathan Kan, Ted Kim, and Harshil Kotamreddy
    They are a student and researcher at the
    <a href="https://www.calstatela.edu/">California State University of Los Angeles</a>. They are responsible for the content
    of the site. Jiang Guo is Associate Editor & Instructor.
    <p>
        The site is hosted by the <a href="https://www.calstatela.edu/">California State University of Los Angeles</a> CS 3337 Software Engineering by Jiang Guo, who
        provide the server, disk space, and network bandwidth for the site.
        They also employ the editor, and support him in his various digital
        activities (of which this is but one).
    </p>
    <p>
        The online books listed on this page have been authored, placed online,
        and hosted, by a wide variety of individuals and groups throughout
        the world (and throughout history!).

    </p>
    <h2>Where It Started</h2>

    The Bookshelf originally was founded in November 2020 by the current
    editors, while they were student at
    <a href="https://www.calstatela.edu/">California State University of Los Angeles</a>.

    <h2>What Gets Listed</h2>
    <p>
        In practice, most of what gets included in our curated collection
        comes directly or indirectly
        from reader suggestions, either from
        the extended shelves, or from elsewhere online.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <h2>Who Else Works With Us</h2>
    <p>
        The Bookshelf is developed in collaboration with many
        the group itself and possibly our greatest companion, which is the google. Here are some that haven't yet been mentioned.
    </p>

        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://www.calstatela.edu/faculty/prof-jiang-guo">Jiang Guo - Instructor/Associative Editor</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://www.calstatela.edu/">California State University of Los Angeles</a>
            (who supply the cataloging information we use in those listings.)</li>
     </ul>

    <h2>Privacy Considerations</h2>

    We log accesses to this site with the standard data provided in
    World Wide Web requests
    (which includes, among other things, URLs accessed, time of access, the
    IP address of the site making the request, the browsing program and
    machine type (if your
    browser gives out this information), and the previous URL visited (if your
    browser gives out this information.) The identity of the user
    is not recorded. Also, note that because the books we list are mostly
    on other web sites, and we don't log access to links that leave the site,
    we do not log what books you actually read online, unless
    they're stored here at CSULA.
    <p>
        We may tabulate aggregate user statistics from our logs to better
        understand usage of our site, and report on its usage to third parties
        (but only in ways that do not allow specific users to be identified).
        We may also, in the future, if a user so requests, use that
        individual's access data to provide customized views of the site, but
        we do not do so now.
    </p>
    <p>
        We do <b>not</b> give out information about specific accesses or users
        to third parties,
        unless required by law to do so.
        (To date, we never have been so required, to the best of the editor's
        knowledge.)
        The editor believes that access data collected at this site would be
        legally protected by the same patron protections as other library access
        data, but hasn't checked with a lawyer, or with the Libraries, about this.
        In any case, he intends to raise
        any appropriate legal challenges to any attempt to subpoena individual access
        information. (Readers should be aware that the "USA Patriot Act"
        may limit our ability to resist such requests, or inform people that such
        requests have been made. For more about the
        Patriot Act and libraries, see the
        <a href="http://www.ala.org/advocacy/advleg/federallegislation/theusapatriotact">American Library Association's
            information on this subject</a>.)
    </p>
    <p>
        Cookies are not required to access this site. The editor makes his best
        effort to tell people when cookies are required to access books hosted
        elsewhere that are listed by
        this site (so that users can keep cookies turned off if they wish).
    </p>
    <p>
        The sites that hold the books we link to generally
        have different privacy policies not under our control.
    </p>

    <h2>Copyrights and Permissions</h2>
    <p>
        Links to any point in these pages are welcome, and ordinary links
        do not require permission.
        However, if you want to redistribute or 'mirror' substantial
        portions of these listings or pages, or create derivative works
        or displays based on
        them (beyond what is clearly allowed by fair use or the inherent
        public domain status of facts by themselves), you must abide by
        licenses associated with them, or where no license is given,
        obtain prior written permission. Write to the editor at the
        address below to pursue permissions.
    </p>
    <p>
        The editors of this page intends to respect any copyrights
        of the authors of the books listed by the site. We will not knowingly
        list a book that is neither online with the copyright holder's
        permission, nor in the public domain (or otherwise legally available)
        in the country where the online book is stored.
        We also attempt to warn people about books that
        are legal to access in a server's hosting country, but may be illegal
        to access from the US (where this site is located).
    </p>
